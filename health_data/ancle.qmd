## Background

This project is the most comprehensive data base migration yet.

The client's wish, was for an old Microsoft Access data base to be migrated to REDCap, for continuous use and data collection.

## Database

Here are a few characteristics:

-   Around 3000 entries

-   5 collection instruments, 4 of them were to be used as repeatable instruments.

-   80 variables

## Coding

I have collected my scripts in a repository, which will be made public when I have finished the work.
