Hi! I am a medical doctor and PhD-student at Danish Stroke Centre, Aarhus University Hospital and <a href="[mailto:andreas@gdamsbo.dk](https://pure.au.dk/portal/da/persons/andreas-gammelgaard-damsbo(e3c4afce-3eba-4456-8b8b-2fd90775c87a).html)">Aarhus University</a>.

This page is my professional website, where I will try to write about the research and other projects I am engaged with through my work. Don't hesitate to contact me if you want to collaborate or want to share your thoughts on some of my work.

I also do other things than work, which I might link to.

Take care!
