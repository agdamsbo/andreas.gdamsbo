Hi! I am **Andreas Gammelgaard Damsbo**. I am a medical doctor and PhD-student at the <a href="https://www.en.auh.dk/departments/danish-stroke-centre/">Danish Stroke Centre, Aarhus University Hospital</a> and <a href="https://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/andreas-gammelgaard-damsbo(e3c4afce-3eba-4456-8b8b-2fd90775c87a).html">Aarhus University</a>.

This page is my professional website, where I will try to write about the research and other projects I am engaged with through my work. Don't hesitate to contact me if you want to collaborate or want to share your thoughts on some of my work.

I also do other things than work, which I might link to.

Take care!
