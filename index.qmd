Hi! I am a medical doctor, PhD-student, open source activist and father of two girls.

On this page is my CV, I will write about some hobby projects, and just share what I am concerned with. Some will be in English, some in Danish. Take care!

\[This is still very much a work in progress, but these are my intentions\]
