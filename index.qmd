Hi! I am **Andreas Gammelgaard Damsbo**. I am a medical doctor and PhD-student at the [Danish Stroke Centre, Aarhus University Hospital](https://www.en.auh.dk/departments/danish-stroke-centre/) and [Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University](https://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/andreas-gammelgaard-damsbo(e3c4afce-3eba-4456-8b8b-2fd90775c87a).html).

This is my website, where I mostly will write about the research and other projects I am engaged with through my work. Don't hesitate to contact me if you want to collaborate or want to share your thoughts on some of my work.

I use open source software in my work as much as possible, and document my work following the same ideology for others to get inspired or criticise. Likewise, the source for this page is freely available [on GitHub](https://github.com/agdamsbo/andreas.gdamsbo).

I also do other things than work, which I might link to or write about here as well.

Take care!
