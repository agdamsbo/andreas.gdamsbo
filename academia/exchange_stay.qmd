## Visiting the Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health

From 10 August and until 9 October I am visiting professor Lara Boyd and her Brain Behavior Laboratory, a part of the Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health. 

I am very much looking forward to my stay here. Below I have listed the initial brainstorm of thing to do while at the lab, as I am here to explore and be inspired. No specific method planned. I will try to write up a little something on the most interesting parts.
