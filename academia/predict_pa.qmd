## Intro

I am presenting a poster at European Stroke Organisation Conference 2023 on predicting changes in physical activity after stroke.

The poster will be part of the [poster viewing programme on Wednesday, May 24 2023](https://apps.congrex.com/esoc2023/en-GB/pag/presentation/350689).

## Background

We have been interested in trying to predict patients at increased risk of physical activity decline after stroke.

## About the poster

I wanted to divert from the traditional text heavy poster format. For the session at ESOC, I will be at the poster stand for most of the time to talk about our work. THe abstract will be available for download for the participants.

The poster is created in PowerPoint, as this was where I had an available template. The template was later abandoned though.

The fonts are [Alice](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Alice/about) and [Jost\*](https://github.com/indestructible-type/Jost). Both are open source and free to use.

The icons are from the [Material Design Icons](https://pictogrammers.com/library/mdi/), and also open source.
