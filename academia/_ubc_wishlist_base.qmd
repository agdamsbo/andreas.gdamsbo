### Initial wishlist for my visit

The following list will be edited and expanded as new projects and options are added

-   [ ] Learn about online cognitive assesment - is it valid?

-   [ ] Ideas for setting up a workflow for automated MR scan assessments using the free and open source ADS tool[@liu2021] - this specific tool is not in use, but the group uses other similar tools.

-   [ ] Follow the most interesting projects and enjoy this opportunity to explore

-   [ ] Write midterm evaluation for AU

-   [ ] Prepare for oral presentation at the World Stroke Congress, abstract title is "Persistent low physical activity after stroke and risk of new vascular event or death" - I'll be sharing more on this later.
