During my work in clinical research I have acquired a special set of skills in working with data collection, data bases and data analysis. I am very much interested in sharing these skils and knowledge.

I am primarily working with R and REDCap. I have published one R package to CRAN and am actively maintaining two other packages on GitHub (on is on its way to CRAN). I am also working on a handbook for clinical researchers on working with R and REDCap.

I have worked as a data science consultant on a few projects. Here I will also share a few of them as a portfolio. Please don't hesitate to [contact me](mailto:andreas@gdamsbo.dk) if you need help on a project.
