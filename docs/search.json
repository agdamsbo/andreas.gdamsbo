The process is documented including the REDCap assessment tool in this repository. I had planned to only allocate one assessor to each subject, but after an initial batch of 50 subject, assessed by all assessors, two assessors were allocated for each subject. Also, it was decided to have all assessments with disagreement evaluated by a third assessor for a consensus score. This work is still under-way (as of 13. May 2024).\nData analysis and further work is documented in another repository, which was also intended for poster generation with quarto. I did not like the text-heavy templates and did not have the time to start creating my own, so I ended up using Microsoft’s PowerPoint, which is great for the task. This is the result."

I mostly host different apps and sevices for my own use, but also a few pages for public access. I needed a way to securely access my homeserver without having access to the router. This led me to renting a small VPS (Debian 12) at Hetzner (cx22) and run a Wireguard instance on this to tunnel all relevant traffic to my home-server. I have been able to find a lot of inspiration online, but nowhere, I found the setup I needed, so here goes for inspiration.\nAfter recently having to setup everything again myself, I am now including a complete set of instructions."

Other rights.\n\n      1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n      2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.\n\n      3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme.

    "text": "Getting R to run in Jupyter Lab\nI am hosting my own small server using the very nice and relatively simple YunoHost. It is currently based on Debian Bullseye\nI have installed Jupyter Lab through their apps repository and followed the steps below to get an R kernel to run.\nThis project is mainly for my own learning purposes and to be used as notes for future me when problems occur.\n\n\nInstallation\nInspiration is from https://www.cahoover.com/data-science/adding-an-r-kernel-to-jupyter-lab/, https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-r-on-debian-10 and https://linux.how2shout.com/install-the-latest-r-programming-language-version-on-debian-11-bullseye/.\nAfter R is installed, launch R in the terminal to install some packages:\nsudo -i R\nThese packages are suggested by Christopher Hoover, though I have changed devtools to remotes.\n# install from CRAN\ninstall.packages(c('repr', 'IRdisplay', 'evaluate', 'crayon', 'pbdZMQ', 'remotes', 'uuid', 'digest')) \nThere are seven packages we need to install to setup the R Kernel in the Jupyter Lab environment.\n\nrepr: String and binary representations of objects for several formats mime types.\nIRdisplay: An interface to the rich display capabilities of ‘Jupyter’ front-ends (e.g. ‘Jupyter Notebook’) https://jupyter.org. Designed to be used from a running ‘IRkernel’ session https://irkernel.github.io.\nevaluate: Parsing and evaluation tools that make it easy to recreate the command line behavior of R.\ncrayon: Colored terminal output on terminals that support ‘ANSI’ color and highlight codes. It also works in ‘Emacs’ ‘ESS’. ‘ANSI’ color support is automatically detected. Colors and highlighting can be combined and nested. New styles can also be created easily. This package was inspired by the ‘chalk’ ‘JavaScript’ project.\npbdZMQ: pbdZMQ is an R package providing a simplified interface to ZeroMQ with a focus on client/server programming frameworks. Notably, pbdZMQ should allow for the use of ZeroMQ on Windows platforms.\nremotes: Collection of package development tools.\nuuid: Tools for generating and handling of UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers).\ndigest: digest provides `hash’ function summaries for GNU R objects.\n\nFinally, the IRkernel pacakge, the R kernel for Jupyter, is installed:\n# from Github \nremotes::install_github('IRkernel/IRkernel')\nThe following is specific to the installation on Yunohost:\nTo get the IRkernel to be recognised in jupyterlab on the YunoHost install, I had to modify the installspec() to allow for a specified path to jupyter as well as to specify the jsonlite functions used in the function. I forked the IRkernel and modified the installspec(), so the next step will look like this:\nsource(\"https://github.com/agdamsbo/IRkernel/blob/master/R/installspec.r\")\ninstallspec(user=FALSE, jupyter_path=\"/opt/jupyterlab/venv/bin/jupyter\") # This will give access to all users\nAfter this, jupyterlab should recognise the R kernel. If not, try to stop and start the service. Have fun at it."

Here I will just discuss a few favourite examples.\n\nPlotting text with contrast based on background\nThe first example is just a small exercise in implementing ideas as a function.\nInspired by a discussion on StackOverflow and an example, I created a function to determine contrast levels. My use case was colouring text based on background colour, but the function can be used in many other cases as well.\nSimilar functionality is used in Polychrome::swatch() or scales::show_col(), but the function used for determining contrast here is a little crude. The contrast_text() is a little more sophisticated, and can be used on its own. Is it necessary? You’ll decide for yourself.\n\nlibrary(stRoke)\ncontrast_text(c(\"red\",\"yellow\",\"blue\",\"green\",\"purple\", \"orange\",\"white\",\"black\"))\n\n[1] \"white\" \"black\" \"white\" \"black\" \"white\" \"white\" \"black\" \"white\"\n\n\nTo give an example, I have modified the scales::show_col().\n\n\nA modification of the scales::show_col() function to use stRoke::contrast_text() for text coloring.\n## Operator used by library(scales), but not exported\n## Defined for convenience.

Most recently a new approach has gained some traction: “Tournament Methods”.(Churilov, Johns, and Turc, n.d.)\n\nwin_prob()\nThis approach has been implemented in the genodds-package(Johns 2022), and based on the work by Zou, Zou, and Choi (2022), I have created the win_prob() function:\n\nlibrary(stRoke)\nwin_prob(\n  data = stRoke::talos,\n  response = \"mrs_6\",\n  group = \"rtreat\",\n  sample.size = FALSE,\n  print.tables = FALSE\n)\n\n     Zou et al's winP (doi: 10.1161/STROKEAHA.121.037744) \n\nProbability of a random observation in Placebo group \n      will have a higher response score than a random\n      observation in Active group:\n\n       winP: 0.400 (0.612, 0.372)      p=0.0125\n--------------------------------------------\n\nThe numbers needed to treat (NNT) are: -9\n\n\n\n\ngeneric_stroke()\nThe author of the genodds-package is also maintaining the rankinPlot-package, which makes it very easy to create the classic Grotta Bars visualising changes in mRS score distributions.(Johns 2023)\nI have created the generic_stroke()-function to easily create table one, Grotta bars and binary or ordinal logistic regression plots with confidence intervals.\n\nlibrary(stRoke)\nlst &lt;- generic_stroke(df = talos,\n               \"rtreat\",\n               \"mrs_6\",\n               variables = c(\"hypertension\", \"diabetes\", \"civil\"))\n# names(lst)\n\nThe first element in the function is a classical table 1 created using the great package gtsummary(Sjoberg et al. 2021) using tbl_summary():\n\n\nPrinting Table 1\nlibrary(gtsummary)\nlst$`Table 1` |&gt; as_gt()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacteristic\nOverall, N = 2001\nActive, N = 791\nPlacebo, N = 1211\n\n\n\n\nhypertension\n101 (50%)\n38 (48%)\n63 (52%)\n\n\ndiabetes\n23 (12%)\n9 (11%)\n14 (12%)\n\n\ncivil\n\n\n\n\n\n    alone\n59 (30%)\n22 (28%)\n37 (31%)\n\n\n    partner\n141 (70%)\n57 (72%)\n84 (69%)\n\n\n\n1 n (%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next element is a figure showcasing the grottaBar() function.\n\n\nPrinting Figure 1\nprint(lst$`Figure 1`)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe function has been expanded lately to allow further customisation. The generic_stroke() uses the default implementation.\nThe last element is the only original part of the implementation. This is a horizontal forest plot of regression analysis values from the ci_plot() function, which plots model coefficients with confidence intervals based on a supplied model. Supports binary and ordinal logistic regression and other functions formatted in a similar way.\n\n\nPrinting Figure 2\nprint(lst$`Figure 2`)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe output is a ggplot-element and is highly modifiable."

    "text": "A long-term, registry based follow-up\nOur study is based on the [TALOS-trial](https://www.doi.org/10.1161/STROKEAHA.117.020067) cohort,. The trial was a randomised trial on citalopram in acute ischaemic stroke conducted between 2013-2016. For this study we did long-term follow-up on the pre-defined composit outcome of new vascular event (stroke, TIA or MI) or death of any cause. These data were obtained through the Danish health registries, that are based on a civil registration number given to all people living in Denmark. We have had access to hospital admission data nd death registrations. When sending in the abstract for WSC, I expected we would have been able to enrich our dataset further with data on socio-economic status as well as educational level. We are still awaiting these data, however, but these will be included when we get to the final publication of our findings."

    "text": "Main points presented\nAt the WSC I will be presenting two of our main findings:\n\nPatients with a persistent low level of physical activity (in the lowest quartile of our physical activity score measure) at both seven days just prior to their stroke as well as six months post-stroke have a significantly increased hazards ratio (HR) of our composite outcome, compared to the group of patients in the 2nd-4th quartile at both pre-stroke and six months post-stroke.\nPatients in the lowest quartile pre-stroke, but in one the the higher quartile post-stroke, did not have a HR statistically significantly different from the group with a higher level at both time points.\n\nI think the first point is what we expected, but the second point is very encouraging. Though, this trial is observational, it still highlights, that increasing physical activity level in the stroke population may lower the risk of a clinical outcome such as new vascular event or death."

    "text": "Smoothed survival plot\nI have been quite restricted in data management and which figures to present, as I have been working on a protected server, and I have only been allowed to present cumulative data. This means, that I also had to find a way to smooth the classic survival curve plot, as each step on the classic plot is representing a single subject, and thereby not allowed.\nBelow is the code I used for my presentation at WSC with some sample data. This code is based on the `ggsurvfit`-package, which eases the work with survival data, but I had to use a different approach to the smooth line and confidence interval.
